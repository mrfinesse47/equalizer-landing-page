## My process

nothing too serious for this exercise.

- plan - code - test/compare - repeat

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SASS

- No JS in this project

### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned in this project was how to add multiple background images, I found that the background image that comes first has a higher Z index.

```css
background-image: url("/assets/bg-pattern-1.svg"),
  url("./assets/bg-main-desktop.png");
background-position: left 1128px top 0px, left -330px top -200px;
background-size: 312px 468px, auto;
background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
```

Thank you to community in the way that knowledge is shared, it wouldn't be possible to accomplish anything without your stack overflows of the world.
